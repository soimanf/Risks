abstract = {Using a sample free of survivor bias, I demonstrate that common factors in stock returns and investment expenses almost completely explain persistence in equity mutual funds' mean and risk-adjusted returns. Hendricks, Patel and Zeckhauser's (1993) "hot hands" result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers.},

abstract = {We implement a long-horizon static and dynamic portfolio allocation involving a risk-free and a risky asset. This model is calibrated at a quarterly frequency for ten European countries. We also use maximum-likelihood estimates and Bayesian estimates to account for parameter uncertainty. We find that for most European countries the dividend-price ratio and inflation have predictive power. For countries where returns are predictable, we demonstrate out-of-sample economic signi cance for the long-horizon allocation. Parameter uncertainty plays a second-order role, dominated by strong variation in the dynamic allocation itself induced by large variations in the state variables. The market timing appears economically relevant for many countries.},

abstract = {Despite a growing interest, researchers and practitioners still struggle to transfer the blockchain concept introduced by Bitcoin to market-oriented application scenarios. To shed light on the technology's usage in markets with asymmetric information, this study analyzes the eect of the blockchain's public transparency paradigm on behavioral patterns and market outcomes. In line with prior research, our ndings indicate that the blockchain's shared record mitigates adverse selection eects and reduces moral hazard of good market participants (plums). In addition, we identify an incentive for bad market participants (lemons) to behave opportunistically in the presence of perfect quality information. More specically, the disclosed information allows them to learn about quality dierences between plums and lemons, deceive their counterparties, and move to a new equilibrium with increased utility. As a result, the market collapses despite a welfare gain and future generations are denied market access. In addition, plums and lemons are committed to inecient equilibria following irrational behavior. In total, this study aims to provide initial guidance for blockchain adoption in the context of markets with information asymmetries and highlights risks that arise from competition, the exposure to irrational behavior, and the implementation of services on the infrastructure level.},

abstract = {Mining is a central operation of all proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies. The vast majority of miners today participate in "mining pools" instead of "solo mining" in order to lower risk and achieve a more steady income. However, this rise of participation in mining pools negatively affects the decentralization levels of most cryptocurrencies. In this work, we look into mining pools from the point of view of a miner: We present an analytical model and implement a computational tool that allows miners to optimally distribute their computational power over multiple pools and PoW cryptocurrencies (i.e. build a mining portfolio), taking into account their risk aversion levels. Our tool allows miners to maximize their risk-adjusted earnings by diversifying across multiple mining pools which enhances PoW decentralization. Finally, we run an experiment in Bitcoin historical data and demonstrate that a miner diversifying over multiple pools, as instructed by our model/tool, receives a higher overall Sharpe ratio (i.e. average excess reward over its standard deviation/volatility).},

We collect a broad sample of firms that invest in blockchain technology and examine the stock price reaction to the first public revelation of this news. Initial reactions average close to +13{\%} and are followed by reversals over the next three months. However, we report a striking difference based on the credibility of the investment. Blockchain investments that are at an advanced stage or are confirmed in subsequent financial statements are associated with higher initial reactions and little or no reversal.

abstract = {This study examines whether the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin and Ethereum) evolve over time based on Lo's (2004) adaptive market hypothesis (AMH). In particular, we measure the degree of market efficiency using a generalized least squares-based time-varying model that does not depend on sample size, unlike previous studies that used conventional methods. The empirical results show that (1) the degree of market efficiency varies with time in the markets, (2) Bitcoin's market efficiency level is higher than that of Ethereum over most periods, and (3) a market with high market liquidity has been evolving. We conclude that the results support the AMH for the most established cryptocurrency market.},

abstract = {This paper examines the benefits and constraints of applying blockchain technology for the Paris Agreement carbon market mechanism and develops a list of technical requirements and soft factors as selection criteria to test the feasibility of two different blockchain platforms. The carbon market mechanism, as outlined in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, can accelerate climate action by enabling cooperation between national Parties. However, in the past, carbon markets were limited by several constraints. Our research investigates these constraints and translates them into selection criteria to design a blockchain platform to overcome these past limitations. The developed selection criteria and assumptions developed in this paper provide an orientation for blockchain assessments. Using the selection criteria, we examine the feasibility of two distinct blockchains, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for the specific use case of Article 6.2. These two blockchain systems represent contrary forms of design and governance; Ethereum constitutes a public and permissionless blockchain governance system, while Hyperledger Fabric represents a private and permissioned governance system. Our results show that both blockchain systems can address present carbon market constraints by enhancing market transparency, increasing process automation, and preventing double counting. The final selection and blockchain system implementation will first be possible, when the Article 6 negotiations are concluded, and governance preferences of national Parties are established. Our paper informs about the viability of different blockchain systems, offers insights into governance options, and provides a valuable framework for a concrete blockchain selection in the future.},

abstract = {In this study, we employ a TVP-FAVAR connectedness approach in order to investigate the transmission mechanism in the cryptocurrency market. To this end, we concentrate on the top 9 cryptocurrencies by virtue of market capitalization and one market factor – based on 45 additional digital currencies – capturing the co-movements in the cryptocurrency market. The period of study spans between August 7, 2015 and May 31, 2018. We find that the dynamic total connectedness across several cryptocurrencies exhibits large dynamic variability ranging between 25{\%} and 75{\%}. In particular, periods of high (low) market uncertainty correspond to strong (weak) connectedness. We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still influences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency. A simplified application concentrating on bivariate portfolios is indicative of potential hedging opportunities using dynamic hedge ratios and dynamic portfolio weights.},

abstract = {Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.},

Nevertheless, there are few studies which focus on this issue. Furthermore, the influence of factors relating to the business environment which may support or derail improvement efforts is not considered in previous studies. In order to address these limitations, a model is proposed in which the impact of environmental factors is considered by integrating SWOT analysis into the FMEA method in order to support the appraisal of competing risk-based improvement efforts. The impact of SWOT variables is deployed using a decision support model based upon the benefit, cost, opportunity, risk and organisational readiness index (BCOR2) approach in order for the FMEA team to select from competing corrective actions. A case example from industry is provided in which the proposed model is applied. This example illustrates that this new model contributes successfully to good practice by identifying the most appropriate corrective action option to take and improves upon the decisions provided by existing developments of the FMEA methodology.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are operated by a handful of mining pools. Nearly 95{\%} of Bit coin's and 80{\%} of Ethereum's mining power resides with less than ten and six mining pools respectively. Although miners benefit from low payout variance in pooled mining, centralized mining pools require members to trust that pool operators will remunerate them fairly. Furthermore, centralized pools pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up possibilities for collusion between pools for perpetrating severe attacks. In this work, we propose SMARTPOOL, a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. Our protocol shows how one can leverage smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining SMARTPOOL gives transaction selection control back to miners while yielding low variance payouts. SMARTPOOL incurs mining fees lower than centralized mining pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SMARTPOOL implementation on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. To date, our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, costing miners a mere 0.6{\%} of block rewards in transaction fees.},

However decentralization cannot be taken for granted, as many presumably distributed cryptocurrency-mining activities have witnessed the rise of mining pools over time. We study the centralization and decentralization forces in the creation and competition of mining pools: risk-sharing benefits attract independent miners to pools, leading to centralization; however, pool concentration can be moderated through cross-pool diversification and endogenous pool fees. In particular, we show that larger pools charge higher fees, leading to disproportionally less miners to join and thus a slower pool size growth. Empirical evidence from Bitcoin mining supports our model predictions. },

I show that a low score of relation implies that a subsidiary inefficiently employed capital sourced from its parent, and therefore is forced to improve named efficiency as a standalone company.

abstract = {Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency, redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges. Furthermore, extensive comparisons are provided on the characteristics and performance of the most promising post-quantum public-key encryption and digital signature schemes for blockchains. Thus, this article seeks to provide a broad view and useful guidelines on post-quantum blockchain security to future blockchain researchers and developers.},

abstract = {The narrative of a Bitcoin is a bubble is very common. We employ statistical techniques to empirically evaluate such claim. A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset's price to strict local martingales — a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset's price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017.},

The following conclusions are reached: (1) PECR is constructed to depict the deviation degree between the price and production cost, while BC is used to illustrate the bubble size in the price, and both are effective measures; (2) the number of unique addresses is a suitable measure of the use value of Bitcoin, and this result has passed the Granger causality test; (3) PECR and BC are verified via the LPPL model, and the next large bubble is expected in the second half of 2020.

abstract = {The ongoing, in-depth transformation of the electricity sector towards increased use of alternative, renewable energy sources extends beyond a simple decentralisation drive in the electricity market. The transformation process is characterised by the interplay of old and new technologies from the energy sector as well as structural coupling with other sectors, such as the information and communications technology (ICT), enabling the technology transfer as well as market entry by information technology (IT) actors. Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach to the current organisation form of the energy market. This paper discusses the applicability and prospects for blockchain-based technologies in the energy sector, which are described using the term "blockchain energy". For the purposes of this study, blockchain energy encompasses all socio-technical and organisational configurations in the energy sector based on the utilisation of the blockchain principle for energy trading, information storage, and/or increased transparency of energy flows and energy services. In the following chapters, the authors present and discuss the current transformation in the electricity market, followed by a review of the different utilisation possibilities for blockchain technologies in the energy sector and a discussion of the barriers and potential for blockchain energy using a transition studies perspective. Finally, the opportunities and risks of blockchain energy are discussed.},

abstract = {[Figure presented] The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.},

More uninformed trading allows market makers to reduce their inventory holding costs and adverse information cost, leading to lower trading costs and liquidity improvement. Using a GAM model, we find that stock splits positively affect stock liquidity between 1996 and 2013 in China.},

Then we investigate crypto-currencies as alternative investment assets, studying their returns and the co-movements of altcoin prices with bitcoin and against each other. We evaluate their addition to investors' portfolios and document they are indeed able to enhance the diversification of portfolios due to their little co-movements with established assets, as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate pure portfolios of crypto-currencies: an equally-weighted one, a value-weighted one, and one based on the CRypto-currency IndeX (CRIX). The CRIX portfolio displays lower risk than any individual of the liquid crypto-currencies. We also document the changing characteristics of the crypto-currency market. Deepening liquidity is accompanied by a rise in market value, and a growing number of altcoins is contributing larger amounts to aggregate crypto-currency market capitalization.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the focal actors in a blockchain network and their heterogeneity in splits. Disagreements in blockchain communities often lead to splits in both the blockchain and the community. We use three key elements of the actor-network theory — punctualization, translation, and actor heterogeneity—and employ case study methodology to examine Bitcoin splits. We identify several human actors, such as miners, developers, merchants, and investors, as well as non-human actors, including blockchain, exchanges, hardware manufacturers, and wallets, involved in Bitcoin splits. Our results show that the consolidation of actors in homogeneous groups plays a key role in blockchain splits. We further describe how the human and non-human actors' fluid moves into micro and macro actor positions in the network affect the development of the split. In addition, we discuss the roles of these actors and their engagement in forming micro and macro agencies in blockchain splits.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as new economic investment assets globally in recent years. This study examines market reactions to major news events associated with cryptocurren-cies. Abnormal returns as well as cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around major news announcements, both positive and negative, are investigated for three primary cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. High abnormal returns are observed on the event day (Day 0), and CARs typically diverge during event windows of (−3, 6) and (0, 6), indicating that the information is not fully reflected in prices immediately after the news events. The CARs that linger for six days after an event suggest that the information flow in the cryptocurrency market is visibly slow. The magnitudes of CARs are larger for negative events than for positive events, implying that the market reaction to negative events is stronger than to positive announcements. The findings of this study may have crucial implications for investors, arbitragers and practitioners as we document evidence of potential trading opportunities for investors who initiate a trading position even after announcements.},

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–14{\%} of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots.},

From GARCH results, it is seen that there is statistically significant volatility spillover from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Litecoin during the period of analysis. The conditional correlation measures point towards the possibility of moderate return co-movement among the crypto-currency returns. The conditional covariance measures show negligible volatility spillover during the initial periods and provide evidence towards increased volatility spillover after 2017. Wavelet coherence measures shows evidence towards correlation among the crypto-currencies to be persistent across the short run, while the pairwise wavelet cross-spectral analysis confirms the findings obtained from conditional covariance measures. It is found that other crypto-currencies are influenced by fluctuations in bitcoin prices. Overall, the results indicate the possibility of turbulence in the crypto-currency markets and point towards the possibility of herding behaviour in crypto-currency markets.},

@article{Singh2020,
abstract = {In the last decade, blockchain has emerged as one of the most influential innovations in software architecture and technology. Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.},

Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and beyond to mitigate future climate change implications. Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs. The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies. The article concludes by identifying appropriate fiscal policy options for this purpose, as well as further considerations on the potential for Blockchain technology in climate change mitigation.},

It is a new paradigm able to modify the way how industries transact. Today, the industries{\&}rsquo; concern is about their ability to handle a high volume of data transactions per second while preserving both decentralization and security. Both decentralization and security are guaranteed by the mathematical strength of cryptographic primitives. There are two main approaches to achieve consensus: the Proof-of-Work based blockchains{\&}mdash;PoW{\&}mdash;and the Proof-of-Stake{\&}mdash;PoS. Both of them come with some pros and drawbacks, but both rely on cryptography. In this survey, we present a review of the main consensus procedures, including the new consensus proposed by Algorand: Pure Proof-of-Stake{\&}mdash;Pure PoS. In this article, we provide a framework to compare the performances of PoW, PoS and the Pure PoS, based on throughput and scalability.},

abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.},

The features of distributed ledgers and smart contract auto-execution possessed by blockchain technology are in line with the requirements of distributed energy resources in billing and settlement, which provides a direction for the application of blockchain technology in the distributed energy resources. The integration of distributed energy resources in China with blockchain technology may break the existing pattern where the production, transportation, distribution and sales of energy are centralized. This paper first summarizes the current status of distributed energy resources in China and blockchain technology, and then uses the Michael Porter five forces model to analyze the competitiveness of distributed energy resources. The rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of alternatives, bargaining power of suppliers, and bargaining power of buyers in energy industry are presented and analyzed. Based on the competitiveness analysis, the SWOT model is used to analyze the joint development model of “blockchain technology + distributed energy resources”, and the feasibility of blockchain technology applied to distributed energy resources systems is revealed. Finally, the paper puts forward the key conclusions that blockchain technology can enhance the competitiveness of distributed energy resources as well as relevant policy recommendations.},

In the empirical part, we evaluate the lead-lag relationships among each type of asset. Consequently, we compare BTC with major currencies and stock exchanges of the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and Japan (USD-SPX, EUR-DAX, GBP-FTSE and JPY-NIK), with currencies and stock exchanges of the U.S., the U.K., Russia, Venezuela and China where BTC is actively traded (USD-SPX, GBP-FTSE, RUB-MOEX, VEF-IBVC and YUAN- SSCE), with major commodities (GOLD and OIL) and with major altcoins (ETH, XRP and LTC) on a daily basis for the period spanning from 2010.07 to 2018.12. We employ Johansen co-integration, Granger causality, impulse response functions and forecast error variance decom- position analyses in our study. Our results show that BTC does not have a long-run relationship with any asset type, but that it has a short-run relationship with gold and especially altcoins, which are both significant and bidirectional. While BTC and altcoins are closely interrelated with each other, BTC price variation is mostly borne by its own prices in all cases.},

As forks can be caused by numerous factors such as latency and miner behavior, their analysis provides insights into these factors, which are otherwise unknown. In this paper we provide an empirical analysis of the announcement and propagation of blocks that led to forks of the Bitcoin blockchain. By analyzing the time differences in the publication of competing blocks, we show that the block propagation delay between miners can be of similar order as the block propagation delay of the average Bitcoin peer. Furthermore, we show that the probability of a block to become part of the main chain increases roughly linearly in the time the block has been published before the competing block. Additionally, we show that the observed frequency of short block intervals between two consecutive blocks mined by the same miner after a fork is conspicuously large. While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation, other causes are also possible. Finally, we show that not only the time difference of the publication of competing blocks but also their propagation speeds vary greatly.},

abstract = {In the evolving and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, new and exciting phenomena arise, including hard forks. Hard forks occur when two groups supporting a cryptocurrency disagree on how the code should evolve. If the changes are incompatible, the code diverges into two chains, essentially doubling the amount of each holder's coin. Forking a coin is theoretically easy. However, maintaining a fork requires great effort and support by members of the community. This Article discusses the November 15, 2018 Bitcoin Cash hard fork and subsequent lawsuit, analyzing anti-trust, negligence, and conversion claims. Forcing de facto fiduciary duties on developers and miners fails to consider that cryptocurrency is a product, likening developers to copyright holders, and the basic premises of fiduciary law. Next, this Article examines the effect of lawsuits on crypto-communities, including legal and economic ramifications of hard forks. While developers may hold some power in cryptocurrency management, external regulations would be impractical and lead to serious ramifications. This Article proposes that developers and miners should protect themselves through contract law and public blockchain networks should be treated as pseudo-sovereigns with internal regulations, for situations such as hard forks.

abstract = {The innovation introduced by cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, blockchain, opens new avenues for research in finance. This PhD dissertation proposes three essays on cryptocurrencies, essays that use the theoretical framework of markets' informational efficiency.The first study aims to explain how the blockchain developed in informal communities is adopted and incorporated by organizations. This study uses the contractual and cognitive approaches of the organization theory in order to provide a theoretical framework for the blockchain technology. Through an illustrated literature review, a two-level analysis presents the potential uses of blockchain based on information access for participants. The objective of the second study is twofold. First, it raises the question about the true nature of Bitcoin. After comparing Bitcoin with currencies, gold and common stocks, we base our analysis on the assumption that cryptocurrencies may be assimilated to common stocks. Second, the financial performance (risk-adjusted return) of Bitcoin is empirically assessed using traditional models such as the CAPM and Fama-French three-factor models. We find that while integrating Bitcoin in portfolio highly improves its diversification, it also provides positive and significant risk-adjusted returns in the World, European and Asia-Pacific regions. The high Bitcoin's volatility and performance lead us naturally to focus on the speculative bubble aspect of cryptocurrencies, which is the focus of the third study. The analysis uses the PSY model of Phillips and Shi, 2018. Second, we focus the analysis on the main peak/burst of the cryptocurrency market at the end of 2017 using the Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model. The results suggest periods of bubbles implying a contagion effect between cryptocurrencies. The conceptual and empirical findings of this dissertation contribute to prior literature on cryptocurrencies on academic grounds. Our findings are also important for businesses and for investors that are interested in the cryptocurrency and blockchain potential as well as for policymakers in charge of their regulation.},

We detect multiple bubble periods for all eight cryptocurrencies, particularly in 2017 and early 2018. We find that higher volatility, trading volume and transactions are positively associated with the presence of bubbles across cryptocurrencies. Regarding the uncertainty variables, the VIX-index consistently demonstrates negative relationships with bubble occurrence, while the EPU-index mostly exhibits positive associations with bubbles.

We estimate the pricing kernel with which users price factors affecting their token holdings. We investigate how traditional risk factors such as market risk are evaluated, as well as how blockchain specific risk factors are priced in. In order to do so, we introduce an asset pricing model and modify its properties to make it applicable to cryptocurrency markets. We group the risk factors into market related and Bitcoin- and Ethereum blockchain specific risk factors. We find that blockchain specific risk factors are priced in. There is evidence that risk factors have moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum specific risk factors with an increasing importance of market factors, providing evidence for a decoupling of on-chain and off-chain trading activity.},

Among all these studies, the interpretation of the drastic fluctuation of bitcoin price attracts a great attention. Many influence factors of bitcoin price were found. However, seldom research reveals the dependence structure between price and its influence factors. By selecting ten interpretable influence factors from the bitcoin network and using copula theory, we find that the bitcoin price has different correlation structures with its influence factors. These findings provide new insights into the behaviour of miners, users, and coins in the bitcoin system, thus leading to meaningful implications for policymakers, investors and risk managers dealing with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.},

@article{Xu2019,
abstract = {Cryptocurrency has attracted extraordinary attention as one of the greatest financial innovations in recent years. Equally noticeable are the increasingly frequent cryptocurrency events, such as hard forks. Put simply, a cryptocurrency hard fork happens when a single cryptocurrency splits in two, which results in original coin owners receiving free forked coins. Such hard forks have resulted in billions of dollars distributed to U.S. taxpayers. Despite ongoing regulatory efforts, to date, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has yet to take a clear position on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency hard forks. The lack of useful guidance when filing tax returns has left taxpayers genuinely confused in the past few years. To fill this regulatory gap, this Note proposes a framework for cryptocurrency hard fork taxation. It explains the underlying technology of cryptocurrency hard forks, examines the recommended guidelines from the American Bar Association and the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants on cryptocurrency hard fork taxation, and references the current practices in Japan and the United Kingdom to lay a solid foundation for the proposed framework. Ultimately, this Note proposes a two-pronged tax on cryptocurrency hard forks. The first tax is levied on the profit made from the receipt of forked coins, and the second tax is levied on the profit made from the disposition of forked coins. A concrete proposal is provided for the applicable coin valuation, tax basis, holding period, and tax rate for the two prongs. Aiming to propose a tax treatment that is closest to the nature of cryptocurrency hard forks, this proposal considers various practical concerns, such as the inefficiency of the cryptocurrency market, the indirect possession of forked coins through third-party exchanges, and the fluctuating trading prices of forked coins when determining the valuation, tax basis, and holding period. This proposal not only provides clarity for taxpayers in filing tax returns and fulfilling tax obligations, but it also relieves the potential tax deferral and tax evasion problems that arise after a cryptocurrency hard fork.},

We also derive closed-form formula of the probability of temporary fork and the expected mining reward of a mining pool. To reveal the long-term trends on the computing power distributions over the competing mining pools, we then develop an evolutionary game framework based on the temporary fork modeling and accordingly characterize the set of stable evolution equilibrium.

The results show a significant average abnormal return of 5.7{\%} on the day of the listing event and 9.2{\%} in the window of three days before until three days after the listing. The effects clearly differ for individual cryptocurrency exchanges, with listings on only a few exchanges yielding significant positive short-term abnormal returns of up to 25.5{\%} on the day of the listing. Other exchanges show no significant effects at all or even significant negative returns, which suggests informed trading or market manipulation. Additional tests show that higher market capitalization in combination with lower trading volume leads to higher abnormal returns at exchange listings of blockchain-based assets.},

abstract = {Using the concept of the stochastic discount factor with critical behavior, we present a self-consistent model for explosive financial bubbles, which combines a mean-reverting volatility process and a stochastic conditional return which reflects nonlinear positive feedbacks and continuous updates of the investors' beliefs and sentiments. The conditional expected returns exhibit faster-than-exponential acceleration decorated by accelerating oscillations, called "log-periodic power law" (LPPL). Tests on residuals show a remarkable, low rate (0.2{\%}) of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the S{\&}P500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly identifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, and in Aug. 1998 and the ITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests confirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides a diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before the Oct. 1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4. years earlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined LPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the last two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical preference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction with Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Nawari2019,
abstract = {Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.},

abstract = {Permissionless blockchains require a protocol to generate consensus. Many prominent permissionless blockchains employ Proof-of-Work (PoW) for that purpose, but PoW possesses significant shortcomings. Various alternatives have been proposed. This paper provides the first formal economic model of the most famous alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and establishes conditions under which PoS generates consensus. A sufficiently modest reward schedule not only implies the existence of an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible but also precludes a persistent forking equilibrium. The latter result arises because PoS, unlike PoW, requires that validators are also stakeholders.},

The article contributes to the debate on the market efficiency of cryptocurrencies in the presence of volatility, considering robust fractional integration methods in both linear and nonlinear setups. We find that markets of Bitcoin and most altcoins considered in our study can be dubbed as efficient, and are also highly volatile, particularly, in the post-crash period that we are experiencing now. The volatilities are more likely to persist for a shorter period than volatilities in the pre-crash period.

The data cover the period from August 1, 2014 to October 31, 2018. Despite the existence of significant interconnectedness between technology sectors worldwide, the results show that contributions from and to the cryptocurrency market are negligible. The cryptocurrency market appears to be less integrated with the technological system and structurally less exposed to systemic risk. To check robustness, application of Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Macho's (2018) wavelet local multiple correlations found an almost exact linear relationship between global technology sectors for periods of quarterly and longer. Additionally, the Granger causality test confirmed the independence results except for in Japan, Turkey and the USA, where possible changes in cryptocurrency prices may be effective in predicting returns. These findings provide insights for cryptocurrency regulators and potential investors around the world.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, which works peer-to-peer without a centralized repository and is accepted as a form of payment all around the world. The "public ledger", which registers transactions, is known as the block chain. A conventional ledger records bills and notes which are used by an organization, but in the case of Bitcoin these are simply data "entries" in the Blockchain sequence. Business Intelligence (BI), according to Investpedia, refers to the procedural and technical infrastructure that collect, store and analyses the data produced by a field of activities or by an individual company. BI is meant to take in all the data being generated by a business and present easy to digest performance measures and trends that will inform management decisions. The paper shows the BI steps and procedures that will help a Bitcoin user, owner or broker make the best decision possible in order to maximize their profits and financial security.

abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues. In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains.},

We analyze returns of cryptocurrencies around 565 stablecoin issuances events for seven different stablecoins between April 2019 and March 2020. Our event study reveals market downturns in the week before issuance and positive abnormal returns in the twenty-four hours around the issuance. Effects differ and remain insignificant for some stablecoin subsamples and issuance size does not significantly affect the abnormal returns.

Altcoins have attracted enthusiasts who enter the market by mining or buying them, but the risks and rewards could potentially be significant, especially when the market is volatile. In this work, we estimate the potential profitability of mining and speculating 18 altcoins using real-world blockchain and trade data. Using opportunity cost as a metric, we estimate the mining cost for an altcoin with respect to a more popular but stable coin. For every dollar invested in mining or buying a coin, we compute the potential returns under various conditions, such as time of market entry and hold positions. While some coins offer the potential for spectacular returns, many follow a simple bubble-and-crash scenario, which highlights the extreme risks—and potential gains—in altcoin markets.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method to measure and monitor the risk in a banking system. Standard tools that regulators require banks to use for their internal risk management are applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk of a regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international banks from 1988 until 2002, I estimate the dynamics and correlations between bank asset portfolios. To obtain measures for the risk of a regulator's portfolio, I model the individual liabilities that the regulator has to each bank as contingent claims on the bank's assets. The portfolio aspect of the regulator's liability is explicitly considered and the methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital levels. In the sample period, the North American banking system gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by regulatory capital requirements. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of 'smart city' brings opportunities to solve these urban problems. The objectives of smart cities are to make the best use of public resources, provide high-quality services to the citizens, and improve the people's quality of life. Information and communication technology plays an important role in the implementation of smart cities. Blockchain as an emerging technology has many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy, automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving blockchain technology applied to smart cities. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we review how blockchain technology is applied in the realm of smart cities, from the perspectives of smart citizen, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, supply chain management, and others. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

We show the bi-directional Granger causality between investor attention and cryptocurrencies (i.e., return and volatility), which is supported by linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests. The quantile regression indicates that the high investor attention is always associated with the positive return. In the overall regression analysis based on the hash algorithm, the investor's attention can significantly predict the return and return volatility. These findings show that investor attention significantly predicts cryptocurrencies, which provide implications for cryptocurrency investors.},

To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51{\%} attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks.

@article{Hofman2019,
abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore a paradoxical situation, asking whether it is possible to reconcile the immutable ledger known as blockchain with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and more broadly privacy and data protection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR's application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings: This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals. Research limitations/implications: Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications: Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications: Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces. Originality/value: The specific question of how GDPR will apply to blockchain information governance solutions is almost entirely novel. It has significance to the design and implementation of blockchain solutions for recordkeeping. It also provides insight into how well “technology-neutral” laws and regulations actually work when confronted with novel technologies and applications. This research will build upon significant bodies of work in both law and archival science to further understand information governance and compliance as we are shifting into the new GDPR world.},

abstract = {The cryptocurrency market has witnessed significant growth in the past few months.
The emergence of hundreds of new digital currencies and the huge increase in the
prices of their leading representatives have attracted a lot of attention from investors.
However, the financial characteristics of the cryptocurrency markets have not been
systematically evaluated yet. As a consequence, there is currently no consensus on
whether cryptocurrencies constitute an individual asset class or if they share substantial
similarities to stocks, bonds, commodities or foreign exchange. Based on Markowitz
et al. (2017), this paper aims to fill this lack of research by evaluating the cryptocurrency market based on seven requirements of an individual asset class. The authors
find that the cryptocurrency market distinguishes itself remarkably from established
asset classes in terms of risk and return. Additionally, the low correlation between the
cryptocurrency markets and these established asset classes induces a diversification
potential for investors, leading to more favorable risk/return profiles of their portfolios.
But also the emergence of investment services and products provided by the financial
industry and the increasingly cost-effective access to cryptocurrencies corroborate the
conclusion that cryptocurrencies can be seen as an individual asset class},

abstract = {Academics and practitioners from a wide range of backgrounds agree that bringing about sustainable, productive changes in organizations is difficult. They disagree, however, on why this is the case. Consequently, they disagree on the most effective approaches to analyzing and solving organizational problems, and on the most effective approaches to implementing solutions. At the heart of the disagreement are differences over the factors that motivate individuals to change their behavior. Behavioral changes on the part of individuals are required for organizational change, and compensation systems affect behavior. Thus, it is critical to consider the role that compensation systems play in the process of organizational change.     The paper explains why establishing a strong, positive relation between rewards and performance is critical to bringing about value-creating organizational change. Throughout it draws on ideas and evidence, both old and new, from theory and practice. The ways in which well-designed compensation systems create value in organizations are grouped into four broad categories.    Specifically, compensation systems:  1. Improve the motivation and productivity of employees,  2. Promote productive turnover in personnel,  3. Mobilize valuable specific knowledge by allowing effective decentralization, and  4. Help overcome organizational inertia and opposition to change.    The paper also analyzes the issue of timing in the implementation of a new compensation system. Conventional wisdom in the field of organizational behavior advocates changing compensation systems only after new "strategy and structure" are designed and implemented. In contrast, I provide arguments and evidence in support of changing compensation systems "early." By early, I mean that compensation systems should be redesigned after managers identify and adopt an over-arching objective for the firm, but before they have completely specified how that objective  translates into a new strategy and/or structure.},

We applied the Granger causality test and a BEKK-MGARCH model to investigate the return and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and Litecoin during the period 2013–2018. We divided this period by the date of August 1, 2017, on which Bitcoin underwent its initial bifurcation. In general, our empirical results show that return and volatility spillovers run in one direction only, i.e., from Bitcoin to Litecoin, before the bifurcation, with the direction of shock transmission being reversed after the bifurcation. We conclude that bifurcation has markedly weakened the market position and pricing influence of Bitcoin within cryptocurrency markets. Since bifurcation is convenient for nearly any cryptocurrency, it will likely continue to pose a risk to the cryptocurrency market as a whole.},

The analysis considers both cyber attacks in general and those targeting cryptocurrencies in particular, and also uses cumulative measures capturing persistence. On the whole, the results suggest the existence of significant negative effects of cyber attacks on the probability for cryptocurrencies to stay in the low volatility regime. This is an interesting finding, that confirms the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of this form of crime and of the tools used by cybercriminals in order to prevent possibly severe disruptions to markets.},

abstract = {Sustainable and responsible investing (SRI) is a strategy that seeks to combine both financial return and social good. The need to create and preserve SRI represents a key argument in investment decision-making, which leads other firms and investors to make strategic decisions beyond financial logic, based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Within this framework, this paper aims to further clarify the understanding of potentially profitable strategies for firms during a global crisis such as a pandemic. Both primary and secondary data were gathered, and descriptive analyses were conducted. In Spain, several IBEX-35 companies announced donations amid the COVID-19 crisis. First, companies were classified into two groups based on donations made. For this, we searched for ESG online news. Then, profitability records amongst companies were identified and compared. In the trading session after the announcements, we found 12 of the 35 companies that made donations had a higher performance index of more than 2 and 3 points over the companies that did not make donations. With a weekly perspective, the difference was 91 and 60 basis points, respectively. These results suggest that in times of upheaval, investors base their strategy on ESG factors, contributing to the emerging literature on individual motives of SRI. Second, by conducting a survey and collecting data from 575 Spanish citizens, we conclude that after this crisis, people{\&}rsquo;s perceptions towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) will change, affecting consumption preferences in those companies that exhibited socially irresponsible or unsupportive behaviour. Hence, the reputation of firms, their social image, and social trust will play an important role in the near future.},

abstract = {Aim/Purpose This paper explored the factors (enablers and barriers) that affect Bitcoin adop- tion in South Africa, a Sub-Saharan country with the high potential for Bitcoin adoption. Background Methodology Contribution Findings In recent years, Bitcoin has seen a rapid growth as a virtual cryptocurrency throughout the world. Bitcoin is a protocol which allows value to be exchanged over the internet without a central bank or intermediary. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are technological tools that arguably can contribute to reducing trans- actions costs. This paper explored the factors that affect Bitcoin adoption in South Africa, a Sub-Saharan country with the high potential for Bitcoin adop- tion, as little is known about the factors that affect Bitcoin adoption and the barriers to adoption. A quantitative questionnaire was distributed to South African virtual communi- ties where Bitcoin is a topic of interest, and 237 quantitative responses were received, along with 212 open-ended comments. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in information systems by providing insights into factors that affect Bitcoin adoption in South Africa. It raises awareness of incentives and barriers to Bitcoin adoption at a time when financial literacy is a crucial issue both in South Africa and worldwide. The results indicate that perceived benefit, attitude towards Bitcoin, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control directly affected the participants' inten- tions to use Bitcoin. Perceived benefit, usefulness, ease of use, and trust-related risk were found to indirectly affect intention to use Bitcoin. Further, it emerges that the barriers to Bitcoin adoption in South Africa consist of the complex nature of Bitcoin and its high degree of volatility.},

@article{Zimmerman2020,
abstract = {Cryptocurrencies exhibit high price volatility and a large degree of speculative activity relative to their usage as a means of payment. I present a model to explain these two facts. A cryptocurrency di ers from other assets due to two distinctive features: a price endogenously determined by the extent of its usage as money, and a structure that limits settlement capacity. A cryptocurrency payment is not nal until it is recorded on a ledger, known as a blockchain. Limited blockchain space means that there is competition between speculative and monetary usage. A user can purchase priority by o ering fees to any miner that adds her payment to the blockchain. Speculative pressure can drive these fees up and crowd out monetary uses. This crowding out undermines the ability of a cryptocurrency to serve as a medium of payment, reducing its value and thus its price. A lower price raises the information content of the trade order ow, making the price more volatile. This is the rst paper to endogenise both the nancial market for cryptocurrency, and the fee-based market for blockchain space. I show that prices of cryptocurrencies are inherently more volatile than those of other assets and, more profoundly, that price formation may work fundamentally di erently than for traditional assets. In particular, the demand curve can be locally upward-sloping, because the act of speculation reduces the value of the cryptocurrency.},

@unpublished{Shiller1980,
abstract = {My initial motivation for considering volatility measures in the efficient markets models was to clarify the basic smoothing properties of the models to allow an understanding of the assumptions which are implicit in the notion of market efficiency. The efficient markets models, which are described in section II below ,relate a price today to the expected present value of a path of future variables. Since present values are long weighted moving averages, it would seem that price data should be very stable and smooth. These impressions can be formalized in terms of inequalities describing certain variances (section III). The results ought to be of interest whether or not the data satisfy these inequalities, and the procedures ought not to be regarded as just "another test" of market efficiency. Our confidence of our understanding of empirical phenomena is enhanced when we learn how such an obvious property of data as its "smoothness" relates to the model, and to alternative models (section IV below).On further examination of the volatility inequalities, it became clear that the inequalities may also suggest formal tests of market efficiency that have distinct advantages over conventional tests. These advantages take the form of greater power in certain circumstances of robustness to data errors such as misalignment and of simplicity and understandability. An interpretation of volatility tests versus regression tests in terms of the likelihood principle is offered in section V.},

The sensitivity of capital expenditures to investment opportunities, representing the efficiency of capital allocation decisions, improves when firms undertake spin-offs. The improvement in the efficiency of capital allocation decisions is most pronounced immediately following the completion of spin-offs (though it attenuates thereafter) and in companies that operate in a moderate (as opposed to a high or a low) number of businesses pre-spin-off. Together, these findings uncover a novel benefit that is associated with spin-offs, an improvement in the process by which managers allocate capital in the divesting firms. These results also suggest that an important theoretical mechanism that may be driving this improvement is that spin-offs enable managers to devote more attention to the capital allocation process within their remaining businesses.},

What determines its valuation is an important open question with far-reaching business and policy implications. Building on information systems and finance literature, we examine the dynamic interactions between social media and the monetary value of bitcoin using textual analysis and vector error correction models. We show that more bullish forum posts are associated with higher future bitcoin values. Interestingly, social media's effects on bitcoin are driven primarily by the silent majority, the 95 percent of users who are less active and whose contributions amount to less than 40 percent of total messages. In addition, messages on an Internet forum, relative to tweets, have a stronger impact on future bitcoin value. Overall, our findings reveal that social media sentiment is an important predictor in determining bitcoin's valuation, but not all social media messages are of equal impact.

Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bit coin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bit coin and the many related crypto currencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bit coin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bit coin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bit coin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals.

These events can be voluntary firm announcements (e.g., new product introduction, alliance formation , channel restructuring) or announcements made by other entities such as regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA approval) or competitors (e.g., new market entry). The event study methodology was developed by finance researchers but has been widely adopted in other fields, including marketing. We review the manner in which event studies have been used in the marketing literature and summarize the current state of knowledge about the design and interpretation of event studies.

abstract = {Cyber risks pose unique threats to financial stability that are not well understood or managed, despite growing investment in research and dependence by financial institutions, consumers, and governments on cyber technol- ogies. This paper considers the ways in which cyber risks differ from traditional financial shocks. In contrast to the financial and policy shocks that have triggered past financial panics, cyber attacks are generally designed and initiated by sentient adversaries in aggressive pursuit of specific malicious goals. If one of those goals is broad financial system instability, a cyber attack may pose unique challenges. Unfortunately, the interactions between the financial contagion channels and the technological and operational risk channels of cyber attacks have not been examined carefully. For example, a sustained attack on a large global financial institution could be contagious across both dimensions, but where and how the contagion chan- nels might feed on each other and accelerate risk is an important area for future work. This paper starts by examining traditional risks to financial stability, such as contagion from excessive leverage. It also examines the current regulatory frameworks and partnerships, both domestic and international, established to increase the resilience of the financial system to cyber risk. The analysis concludes with major concerns and potential gaps in understanding and mitigating cyber risks to financial stability.},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases-Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

Results show that Bitcoin behaves differently to traditional currencies. Traditional currencies typically experience a decrease in returns after negative news arrivals and an increase in returns following positive news whereas Bitcoin reacts positively to both positive and negative news. This suggests investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin irrespective of the sentiment of the news. This phenomenon is exacerbated during bubble periods. Conversely, cryptocurrency cyber-attack news and fraud news dampen this effect, decreasing Bitcoin returns and volatility. Our results contribute to the discussion on the nature of Bitcoin as a currency or an asset. They further inform practitioners about the characteristics of cryptocurrencies as a financial asset and inform regulators about the influence of news on Bitcoin volatility, particularly during bubble periods.},

These are: loss of diversification (portfolio effect), change in growth opportunities, change in operational efficiency, and the flow and assimilation of information (information effect).  The relevance of each channel depends on the mode of a breakup.  We explain conceptually and show empirically, using a sample of 530 breakups (259 spinoffs and 271 equity carveouts), that the portfolio effect is dominant for spinoff parents, while the information effect gains importance for carveout parents.  Our novel insight is that the magnitude of the information effect depends on the pre-announcement information set held by investors; we provide a simple state-space model and empirical evidence to support this intuition.  We also find a relation between the change in operational efficiency and the change in idiosyncratic volatility for spinoff parents.},

When someone transfers a large number of Bitcoins, the market receives this information and traders can adjust their expectations based on the new information. This paper investigates trading volume and its relation to asymmetric information around transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain. We collect data on 2132 large transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between September 2018 and November 2019, where 500 or more Bitcoins were transferred. Using event study methodology, we identify significant positive abnormal trading volume for the 15-minute window before a large Bitcoin transaction as well as during and after the event. Using public information about Bitcoin addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges as proxies for information asymmetry, we find that transactions with high levels of information asymmetry negatively affect abnormal trading volume once the event becomes public knowledge, while some effects are even opposite for transactions with lower information asymmetry. The results show that blockchain transaction activity is a relevant aspect of Bitcoin's microstructure, as informed traders make use of the information in general and adjust their expectations based on the degree of information asymmetry.},

Employing a simulation approach with actual price data from 1877 unique crypto-assets over the period of January 1st, 2015 to June 30th, 2018 reveals that both parametric procedures and non-parametric procedures often result in significant statistical errors. In the presence of event-day clustering, only the Generalized Rank T-Test is both powerful and well specified. To estimate abnormal returns, the market-model with a value-weighted index produces test statistics with distributions closest to expectation. The empirical evidence provided by the simulation then used in the first ever crypto-asset based event-study. Specifically, the event study investigated allegations of insider trading by the worlds largest crypto-asset exchange Binance.com. A total of 44 unique listing announcements during the period of September 2017 to June 2018. produce a statistically significant two day return of 13.6{\%} (CAR(0,1)). However, the GRANK-T test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no insider trading during the three days preceding the announcements.

abstract = {Through the application of the VAR-AGARCH model to intra-day data for three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin), this study examines the return and volatility spillover between these cryptocurrencies during the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period. We also estimate the optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness during both sample periods. We find that the return spillovers vary across the two periods for the Bitcoin–Ethereum, Bitcoin–Litecoin, and Ethereum–Litecoin pairs. However, the volatility transmissions are found to be different during the two sample periods for the Bitcoin–Ethereum and Bitcoin–Litecoin pairs. The constant conditional correlations between all pairs of cryptocurrencies are observed to be higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Based on optimal weights, investors are advised to decrease their investments (a) in Bitcoin for the portfolios of Bitcoin/Ethereum and Bitcoin/Litecoin and (b) in Ethereum for the portfolios of Ethereum/Litecoin during the COVID-19 period. All hedge ratios are found to be higher during the COVID-19 period, implying a higher hedging cost compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Last, the hedging effectiveness is higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Overall, these findings provide useful information to portfolio managers and policymakers regarding portfolio diversification, hedging, forecasting, and risk management.},

abstract = {Purpose-Trade goods have been used as exchange mediums since the first humans. A thousand years ago currency was invented, and it became the dominant exchange medium in today's world. The history of money did not end with the invention of fiat currency, such as US Dollar or Euro. Cryptocurrency is the new development. It is not a trade good, nor a fiat money. "It is a new, experimental kind of money." In this study our purpose is to analyze the factors influencing investors' decision making on investment in cryptocurrencies by using conjoint analysis. Studies suggest that some attributes of cryptocurrencies affect decisions of investors. In this study, the attributes at different levels related to investors' expectations on cryptocurrencies are examined. Methodology-In this study, conjoint analysis has been conducted. Conjoint method is a statistical analysis method and by using this method researchers determine the value of the attributes of a product or a feature for its consumers. Conjoint analysis is a method for analyzing preferences of customers; it is a useful tool for predicting and determining responses of customers to new product features and totally new products. In this case customers are investors and the new product is cryptocurrencies. Conjoint analysis has several types, choice based conjoint analysis is one of them and it is the preferred method for most of the researchers. Findings-Data collected for the study has been analyzed by using Marketing Engineering for Excel software. The findings of the study indicate that profitability, bookkeeping and security are the most important attributes which influence expectations of investors in cryptocurrencies. Five attributes with five levels each are chosen. It is predicted that these attributes are the most important indicators of investor behavior. According to research findings, most important attribute for investors is profitability. This study confirms that the majority of investors have high profit expectation from crypto currencies. But study results also include some unexpected findings. Anonymity is not one of the main concerns for investors and almost equal number of investors prefers very high and very low level of bookkeeping. Conclusion-The conjoint analysis gives a clear view on what investors expect from cryptocurrencies. The results show the attributes to improve when developing a cryptocurrency.},

@article{Jensen1968,
abstract = {In this paper I derive a risk-adjusted measure of portfolio performance (now known as "Jensen's Alpha") that estimates how much a manager's forecasting ability contributes to the fund's returns. The measure is based on the theory of the pricing of capital assets by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965a) and Treynor (Undated). I apply the measure to estimate the predictive ability of 115 mutual fund managers in the period 1945-1964—that is their ability to earn returns which are higher than those we would expect given the level of risk of each of the portfolios. The foundations of the model and the properties of the performance measure suggested here are discussed in Section II. The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. It is also important to note that these conclusions hold even when we measure the fund returns gross of management expenses (that is assume their bookkeeping, research, and other expenses except brokerage commissions were obtained free). Thus on average the funds apparently were not quite successful enough in their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage expenses.},

ICO investors face a high degree of uncertainty because of the unregulated and opaque nature of the ICO market. Using a detailed dataset on 7,450 ICOs, we show that ICOs that retain a larger fraction of their tokens are more successful in their funding efforts and are more likely to develop a working product or platform. Specifically, we estimate that a 1 p.p. increase in token retention leads to a 0.1-0.3 p.p. increase in fundraising success. Moreover, we find that signaling incentives are stronger in periods of elevated market noise.},

First, the historical currencies are unanimously inefficient over the analyzed period. Second, efficiency itself and ranking as well are dependent on the denomination (the US dollar or Bitcoin). Third, most of the coins and tokens were efficient between July 2017 and June 2018. And fourth, the least efficient coins turn out to be Ethereum and Litecoin whereas DASH is the winner as the most efficient cryptocurrency.},

abstract = {The Bitcoin mining protocol has been intensively studied and widely adopted by many other cryptocurrencies. However, it has been shown that this protocol is not incentive compatible, because the selfish mining strategy enables a miner to gain unfair rewards. Existing defenses either demand fundamental changes to block validity rules or have little effect against a resourceful attacker. This paper proposes a backward-compatible defense mechanism which outperforms the previous best defense. Our fork-resolving policy neglects blocks that are not published in time and appreciates blocks that incorporate links to competing blocks of their predecessors. Consequently, a block that is kept secret until a competing block is published contributes to neither or both branches, hence it confers no advantage in winning the block race. Additionally, we discuss the dilemma between partition recovery time and selfish mining resistance, and how to balance them in our defense.},

abstract = {As blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies increase in popularity, their decentralization poses unique challenges in network partitions. In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful "forks" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions. In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocur-rency, with a market capitalization of over {\$}28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities.},

Despite their popularity, the existing evidence on the attractiveness of spinoffs appears piecemeal. In this paper, we examine in detail stock price performance of spinoffs and their parents on a comprehensive sample that covers the last 36 years. We show that excess returns are indeed positive for both subsidiary and parent companies over almost all holding periods considered. For subsidiaries the results appear both economically and statistically significant after various adjustments for risk. This evidence is consistent with investors earning an above normal rate of return by investing in recently spun off subsidiaries. For parents, however, after correcting for one very large positive outlier, returns are not statistically or economically different from zero.},

The most representative features of this new phenomenon are strong price increases and high volatility. The investigations developed in this field are not excessively numerous nor unanimous. Some researches consider this phenomenon to be a bubble, since they don't agree that the price pattern of the cryptocurrencies is justified or explained by their intrinsic value. The present article aims to provide a theoretical framework for the assessment of these new realities embodied by cryptocurrencies. We have created a model which differentiates two types of cryptocurrencies: the cryptocurrencies meant to fund a specific project, and the cryptocurrencies designed for general or non-specific uses. We will also make a distinction between block chain networks designed to work only with cryptocurrencies from those which admit other tasks. Our model establishes the difference between the value of the currency and that of the network. The result of this research is a theoretical valuation model based on three fundamental categories of cryptocurrencies by purpose or finality.},

However, this latter group possess little academic evidence supporting the presence of bubbles since early 2018.

Using a generalized Metcalfe's law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex-ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) being exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).},

abstract = {Managers have repeatedly indicated in surveys that stock splits are intended to improve liquidity. However, previous studies using bid-ask spread and turnover as measures of liquidity find results to the contrary.  This paper offers a new perspective on the issue.  Stock splits can make buying shares more affordable to smaller investors, and split-induced higher trading costs can help attract more brokers to promote the stock and new limit-order traders to supply liquidity.  Accordingly, we hypothesize that managers of firms facing order execution difficulty and lock-in risk have incentives to use stock splits to improve trading speed at the expense of higher trading costs.  Consistent with the hypothesis, we find evidence that firms face trading difficulty prior to splits, and following the split trading speed improves.  On average, about 72 percent of the split announcement returns could be attributed to the net benefit of anticipated trading speed improvement.  Our findings indicate that trading difficulty is an important factor in firms' split decisions, and that the benefit of the improved trading speed outweighs the increased trading costs.},

abstract = {The ability to create high-quality software artifacts that are usable over time is one of the essential requirements of the software business. In such a setting, open source software offers excellent opportunities for sustainability. In particular, safeguarding mechanisms against planned obsolescence by any single actor are built into the definition of open source. The most powerful of these mechanisms is the ability to fork the project. In this paper we argue that the possibility to fork serves as the invisible hand of sustainability that ensures that code remains open and that the code that best serves the community lives on. Furthermore, the mere option to fork provides a mechanism for safeguarding against despotic decisions by the project lead, who is thus guided in their actions to consider the best interest of the community. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {The paper presents a novel analysis specifically investigating as to whether stocks associated with leading blockchain patent-developments influence the price volatility of Bitcoin across multiple time frequencies. It is important to further develop our understanding of the inter-dynamics between this relatively youthful financial product and pricing sensitivities associated with corporate technological advancement. Several interesting results are presented. First, Bitcoin is identified as a volatility receiver instead of a transmitter across all of the time frequencies considered during periods of patent development. Secondly, Microsoft, Mastercard, Intel and Visa contribute the largest volatility spillovers to the Bitcoin market due to patent development. Finally, for most of the companies considered, the calculated spillover effects towards Bitcoin markets are found to increase from the short-term to the long-term. These results suggest the existence of an avenue through which large corporations can influence cryptocurrency prices through their announcements of future technological intentions. The inherent risks incorporated with blockchain and cryptocurrency patent-development should be studied in detail, with particular warnings presented to those companies with no evidence of prior exposure and market knowledge.},

@article{Shu2020,
abstract = {In the past decade, Bitcoin as an emerging asset class has gained widespread public attention because of their extraordinary returns in phases of extreme price growth and their unpredictable massive crashes. We apply the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool for identifying bubbles using the daily data on Bitcoin price in the past two years. We find that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the daily Bitcoin price data fails to provide effective warnings for detecting the bubbles when the Bitcoin price suffers from a large fluctuation in a short time, especially for positive bubbles. In order to diagnose the existence of bubbles and accurately predict the bubble crashes in the cryptocurrency market, this study proposes an adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology based on the LPPLS model and a finer (than daily) timescale for the Bitcoin price data. We adopt two levels of time series, 1 h and 30 min, to demonstrate the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology. The results show that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on this new method is an outstanding instrument to effectively detect the bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator being highly sensitive to the extreme fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble status on a shorter time scale – on a day to week scale, while the long-term LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale – on a week to month scale. The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time detection of bubbles and advanced forecast of crashes to warn of the imminent risk in not only the cryptocurrency market but also other financial markets.},

abstract = {It is no exaggeration to say that since the introduction of Bitcoin, blockchains have become a disruptive technology that has shaken the world. However, the rising popularity of the paradigm has led to a flurry of proposals addressing variations and/or trying to solve problems stemming from the initial specification. This added considerable complexity to the current blockchain ecosystems, amplified by the absence of detail in many accompanying blockchain whitepapers. Through this paper, we set out to explain blockchains in a simple way, taming that complexity through the deconstruction of the blockchain into three simple, critical components common to all known systems: membership selection, consensus mechanism and structure. We propose an evaluation framework with insight into system models, desired properties and analysis criteria, using the decoupled components as criteria. We use this framework to provide clear and intuitive overviews of the design principles behind the analyzed systems and the properties achieved. We hope our effort will help clarifying the current state of blockchain proposals and provide directions to the analysis of future proposals .},

abstract = {Bitcoin has enabled competition between digital cryptocurrencies and traditional legal tender fiat currencies. Despite rapidly increasing acceptance, so far the affirmation of cryptocurrency as better money has been thwarted by dramatic deflationary price instability. Successful at disposing of any central monetary authority, bitcoin has elected to have a fixed deterministic inelastic monetary policy, establishing itself more as digital gold than as a currency. Price stability could be achieved by dynamically rebasing the outstanding amount of money: the number of cryptocurrency units in every digital wallet is adjusted instead of each single unit changing its value. The apparent awkwardness of this unfamiliar paradigm is discussed at length, proving that its only real novelty is about fairness and effectiveness. Furthermore, suggestions are provided about how to ease the effect of contractionary monetary policy. The proposed monetary base adjustment has neutral impact on the overall wallet wealth, as it does not introduce any arbitrary distortion into the intrinsic value dynamics of the wallet. The adjustment is based on a commodity price index determined with a resilient consensus process that does not rely on central third party authorities. It is posited in this paper that a digital cryptocurrency adopting elastic monetary standard is Hayek Money, so named from the Nobel Prize-winning economist: a good money standard providing stable prices for a new economic era.},

Utilizing the unprecedented data availability of Bitcoin statistics, we are able to construct a theoretical exchange rate base of the cryptocurrency with respect to the US dollar. Through the concept of statistical equilibrium verified by the cointegration relationship, we show several interesting points. First, the Bitcoin price dynamics is very well captured by the underlying transaction data which leads to a strong fundamental basis of the cryptocurrency. Second, several historical bubbles hit the confidence intervals around the fundamental price but then start their correction back to the equilibrium. Third, the fundamental price implied by the transaction data is not ever-increasing but reflects the ups and downs of Bitcoin utility in transactions. And fourth, our theory-implied fundamental price suggests that the current (December 2018) Bitcoin price is very close to its fundamental price estimated at around {\$}3,500.},

abstract = {This study aims to compare the diversification risk of the crypto portfolio with those of equity portfolios. For this purpose, the hypothetical index was constructed with 20 cryptocurrencies that hold the highest market capitalization in the Coin Market Cap database, named as the Crypto-Index 20.,The portfolio diversification techniques were used to identify risk linked with the six largest European equity indexes and compared with the Crypto-Index 20. Indexes were considered as an independent portfolio while analysis was completed separately for each of them. Data concerning stock prices and their trade volume were collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database while crypto prices and their trade volume from the Coin Market Cap database. The diversification risk of the stock indexes was measured separately for each portfolio with the same risk techniques and the same methodological process.,Research results indicate that Crypto-Index 20 on average was 76 times riskier than FTSE 100, 55 times riskier than FTSE MIB, 44 times riskier than IBEX 35, 10 times riskier than CAC 40 and 9 times riskier than DAX and MDAX. Crypto-Index 20 comprises a stronger positive correlation and is exposed to higher volatility than six selected European equity indexes.,This research provides practical implications for the investors on the diversification benefits and risks attached to the cryptocurrencies portfolio by comparing it with the traditional equity portfolios. From a policy perspective, regulators might obtain information on the risk properties involved into cryptocurrencies and the possibility of creating an optimal portfolio.},

abstract = {One of the most influential ideas in the past 30 years is the efficient markets hypothesis, the idea that market prices incorporate all information rationally and instantaneously. The emerging discipline of behavioral economics and finance has challenged the EMH, arguing that markets are not rational, but rather driven by fear and greed. Research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin. An adaptive markets hypothesis that reconciles market efficiency with behavioral alternatives applies the principles of evolution?competition, adaptation, and natural selection?to financial interactions. Extending Simon's notion of ?satisficing? with evolutionary dynamics, the author argues that much of what behaviorists cite as counter-examples to economic rationality?loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases?is in fact consistent with an evolutionary model of individual adaptation to a changing environment via simple heuristics. The adaptive markets hypothesis offers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for portfolio management.},

We argue that blockchain forks can be process- or protocol-based and emerge unintentionally or deliberately. We then proceed with a sub-classification of protocol-based forks and study the circumstances under which a chain split may become permanent. It can be shown that the persistency of a fork depends on the nature of the change to the consensus rules and on the relative allocation of the consensus-relevant resources. Lastly, we discuss business implications as well as potential consequences for policy makers and practitioners.},

We contribute to previous work by proposing surprise volume as a new proxy for private information flow and apply extreme value theory in studying dependence for large volume and return, i.e. under situations of market stress. Results from a GARCH-M model indicate that surprise volume is superior in explaining conditional variance and reveals a positive market risk premium. Under conditions of market stress, the return-volume dependence is weaker, albeit mostly significant. The results for the U.S. market are most pronounced in that surprise volume explains ARCH- as well as leverage-effects and, under market stress, the return-volume dependence remains significant and symmetric. For the European and Asian markets, however, the dependence is weaker with asymmetry under market stress, i.e. small minimal returns show lower volume dependence than large maximal returns. We argue that our results are more consistent with a Gennotte and Leland (1990) misinterpretation hypothesis for market crashes than with cascade or behavioral explanations which associate high volume with steep price declines.},

While the technology is known to provide an environment that is fundamentally safer than other existing centralized systems offer, security professionals warn that the current blockchain ecosystem is still immature, harboring many known as well as unknown defects [1]. This thesis draws upon a number of research studies and various other inquiries into blockchain systems security. In addition, this paper gathers and summarizes information regarding 78 recent blockchain cyberattacks and heists, analyzing and categorizing them as to their cause: platform breach, dApps exploit, access point attack, or endpoint hacking. Two of these attacks (the Ethereum blockchain system and the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange) are analyzed in detail using Causal Analysis using System Theory (CAST) method. A novel top-down security assessment method inspired by System Theoretic Process Analysis for Security (STPA-Sec) is used to evaluate a sample blockchain system, such as might be proposed for voting. An analysis of possible vulnerabilities is conducted, and suggestions for remediation and protection.},

This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper.

abstract = {Two experiments are performed to test hypotheses derived from commodity theory. Commodity theory promotes a psychological conceptualization of traditionally economic variables such as supply, demand and utility. The theory concerns itself mainly with the effect of restricted availability upon the valuation of communications, but in the present paper the effect of restricted availability and attainability on the preference for material goods (recipe books) is investigated. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of degree of availability (low, middle or high) and cause of unavailability (accidental unavailability, unavailability due to popularity, unavailability due to limited supply and unavailability due to both limited supply and popularity) on the choice between three recipe books in a simulated product test. The results suggest that the theory is valid only for attractive products. For subjects who were not attracted to the product this relationship was reversed (they avoided choosing the scarce product), indicating the arousal of an 'altruism' motive in the experimental setting. The second experiment was designed to test the effect of attainability (attainable, unattainable changed to attainable and unattainable) and cause of unattainability (accidental, popularity, limited supply and both limited supply and popularity) on the same kind of choice. The results again suggest that commodity theory is valid only for subjects attracted to the good, and only for the restricted attainability situation. For subjects not attracted to the product field no treatment effects were found. Commodity theory makes no clear prediction of the effects of unattainability, so reactance theory was used to predict the effects of this variable. The hypothesis that an unattainable good is valued more than an attainable good had to be rejected. A possible explanation based on the occurrence of frustration in this condition is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

There are many mitigation solutions available to reduce the risk of DDoS attacks, and the researcher represents many techniques to get rid of the DDoS attacks. The main challenge to identify and mitigate the attack is that attack traffic mixes with the legitimate system user traffic so it becomes very important to block the attack traffic because it costs in terms of money and system reputation. Blockchain technology presents the ideology of decentralized distributed database and transaction without the need of any central authority. But utilization of blockchain is not only limited to the financial sector but supply chain, IoT, hospitality sector used blockchain most. The most attractive features of the blockchain like immutability, distributed makes the use of blockchain for mitigation of various Cyber-attacks, and one of them is DDoS Attacks. The solution of DDoS attacks that utilize the blockchain is still in the infancy phase. In this paper, we propose the review or survey of DDoS attacks solutions based on blockchain.

abstract = {Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.},

abstract = {While corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports are intended to faithfully represent CSR performance, voluntarily disclosed CSR information tends to be positive, and demand is rising for both independent assurance and integrated reporting of CSR. However, the supply of CSR assurance is not widespread in the United States, and CSR performance information remains largely separated from supporting and governance information. We thus examine the role of CSR assurance when information on CSR investment level is integrated with information on whether managerial pay is explicitly tied to sustainability. While a firm may report a high level of CSR investment to indicate an authentic commitment to CSR, investors may become skeptical of reported information if managerial pay is explicitly tied to CSR performance. Such pay-for-CSRperformance provides managers with greater incentives to overinvest in CSR and thereby report strong CSR performance. In turn, investors will seek CSR assurance as a disclosure credibility signal. Accordingly, we find that, in the presence of pay-for-CSRperformance and high CSR investment level, investors' stock price assessments are greater only when CSR assurance is also present. Our findings highlight the importance of examining CSR disclosure factor interaction effects, and provide support for the expansion of CSR assurance and integrated reporting.},

abstract = {Blockchain is the latest ‘disruptive innovation' that has caught scholars' attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.},

The equilibrium price of tokens is determined by aggregating heterogeneous users' transactional demand, rather than discounting cash flows as is done in standard valuations models. Endogenous platform adoption builds on user network externality and exhibits an {\$}S{\$}-curve: it starts slow, becomes volatile, and eventually tapers off. The introduction of tokens lowers users' transaction costs on the platform by allowing users to capitalize on platform growth. The resultant intertemporal feedback between user adoption and token price accelerates adoption and dampens user-base volatility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The very considerable statistical literature which has grown up on the use of the moments of populations and samples, and on other quantities allied to these, is rendered confusing by variations in notation and terminology, and by the different aims which authors have had in view in using these quantities. The following notes aim at clarifying the subject by suggesting a uniform and consistent notation, specifying briefly the relations between the different quantities ordinarily used, and summarising the result which have been obtained. The distribution of a variable quantity x can be specified by means of a frequency function f, often termed the probability integral, specifying the total frequency in the population for which the variate is less than an assigned value x. For discontinuous distributions f will be a step function, increasing discontinuously at the values of x at which finite fractions of the total frequency are concentrated, and remaining constant between these values. For certain other distributions f is continuous and differentiable so that df represents the frequency density in the element of range dx, or, the ordinate of a frequency curve at this point. These are the two common cases, but it is also possible for f to be continuous, but not differentiable, and so incapable of representation by a frequency curve.},

In this article, risk premiums of commodity futures are directly related to the physical scarcity of commodities. For this purpose the authors propose a simple decomposition of spot prices into a pure asset price plus a scarcity related price component. This replaces the traditional convenience yield that results from an imperfect no-arbitrage relationship of the term structure of commodity futures prices. The empirical tests confirm that two separate commodity-specific risk premiums affect the pricing of crude oil futures contracts: a net hedging pressure premium and a scarcity premium. The two premiums show different cyclical characteristics. The authors also find that asset market risk factors such as exchange rates or stock market shocks affect the term structure of oil futures prices in a much more homogeneous way than commodity-specific hedging pressure or scarcity shocks do.

@article{Telli2020,
abstract = {This study aims to test multiple structural breaks using Bai-Perron methodology for the crypto markets. We analyze return and volatility (proxied by absolute and squared returns) series of Bitcoin and the following crypto assets: Bitcoin Cash, DASH, Ethereum, IOTA, Litecoin, NEO, XRP. In the analysis, we consider the BTC markets of those 7 altcoins as well as the USD markets. Empirical findings indicate existence of statistically significant structural changes in terms of returns and volatility. Return and volatility series share different dynamics. On the other hand, time series quoted in BTC perform different structural change behavior than the ones quoted in USD. We also observed a clustering of breakpoints in the periods of February–March 2017 and December 2017–March 2018. For the logarithmic returns, in the mean of BTCUSD and series quoted in BTC no structural breaks are available. The mean of logarithmic returns of DASH, ETH and LTC quoted in USD have structural changes corresponding to the beginning of the downtrend in USD price series of the relevant assets. Absolute returns revealed more of structural breaks in terms of volatility than squared returns. Except for IOTA, volatility last longer in the series quoted in USD than the ones quoted in BTC. For the volatility series of ETH, LTC and NEO, regimes in the time series quoted in BTC is affected by the trend change in the USD quoted price series of the asset. We have defined this regime change and trend change relationship as “trend awareness-based interaction”. We also found a specific trend change pattern in the time series. In comparison to the time series of altcoins, BTCUSD is the first one which has the trend change almost in all cases. Besides, the time series of BCH, ETH, LTC and NEO (and DASH partly) follows a specific trend change order as the following: first in USD quoted time series of the altcoin and then in BTC quoted ones, while the time series of IOTA and XRP indicate the opposite.},

@article{Hasanova2019,
abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer-to-peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.},

analysis. We first start with the micro-level analysis by performing a detailed risk assessment. Here, we take into
consideration technological issues, such as such as consensus, network, cryptographic primitives, quantum and
smart contract attacks, together with financial concerns such as market, information, liquidity, supply, reputation
and environmental risks. Moreover, we propose ways to determine the probability that technological
vulnerabilities can trigger financial risk. Here, we tackle concepts such as financial behavior, responsible
investment and Blockchain literacy, as possible tools for assessing risk. Then, we complete this study with a
macro-level analysis, which consists of the crypto-market appraisal performed with the Porter's five forces
model. This market analysis is performed with respect to its stakeholders, such as the business process
managers, investors, regulators, firms, developers, miners, hackers, exchange and trading platforms, etc. The
results are relative to: 1. an identified continuity between the technological risks and financial ones; 2. a way to
determine the likelihood of triggering financial risks through technical vulnerabilities; 3. a long-term
profitability of the stakeholders' strategy / position within the market.},

Without any central authority issuing the currency, the Bitcoin has been associated with controversy ever since its popularity, accompanied by increased public interest, reached high levels. Here, we contribute to the discussion by examining the potential drivers of Bitcoin prices, ranging from fundamental sources to speculative and technical ones, and we further study the potential influence of the Chinese market. The evolution of relationships is examined in both time and frequency domains utilizing the continuous wavelets framework, so that we not only comment on the development of the interconnections in time but also distinguish between short-term and long-term connections. We find that the Bitcoin forms a unique asset possessing properties of both a standard financial asset and a speculative one.},

abstract = {In this research, we study the multifractality, long-memory process, and efficiency hypothesis of six major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Dash, Litecoin, and Ripple) using the time-rolling MF-DFA approach. For an in-depth analysis, this study uses the quantile regression approach to examine the determinants of efficient markets. The results show that all markets present evidence of long-memory property and multifractality. Furthermore, the inefficiency of cryptocurrency markets is time-varying, and Dash is the least inefficient market while Litecoin is the most inefficient. Finally, we find that higher liquidity improves but higher volatility weakens the efficiency of cryptocurrencies, depending on the quantiles. Therefore, we conclude that high liquidity with low volatility helps active traders to arbitrage away opportunities, resulting in market efficiency.},

abstract = {The probability of successfully spending twice the same bitcoins is considered. A double-spending attack consists in issuing two transactions transferring the same bitcoins. The first transaction, from the fraudster to a merchant, is included in a block of the public chain. The second transaction, from the fraudster to himself, is recorded in a block that integrates a private chain, exact copy of the public chain up to substituting the fraudster-to-merchant transaction by the fraudster-to-fraudster transaction. The double-spending hack is completed once the private chain reaches the length of the public chain, in which case it replaces it. The growth of both chains are modelled by two independent counting processes. The probability distribution of the time at which the malicious chain catches up with the honest chain, or, equivalently, the time at which the two counting processes meet each other, is studied. The merchant is supposed to await the discovery of a given number of blocks after the one containing the transaction before delivering the goods. This grants a head start to the honest chain in the race against the dishonest chain.},

It has wide spectrum of applications ranging from finance to social services and has greatly influenced the emerging business world. Since, blockchain technology is getting embedded in the e-commerce services, the cryptocurrencies are gaining huge prevalence. Bitcoin and ethereum are few such crypto currencies, which have utilized decentralized nature of blockchain. Blockchain can be considered as a distributed database system containing immutable ledgers, which are prone to attack by malicious users. Although, from the initial digital currency to the present smart contract, the utilities of blockchain have been harnessed, the innovative technology has to rely on cryptography for its security. There are several reports, which emphases on the vulnerabilities and security of blockchain, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive and methodical survey in both application and technical views. In this survey article, the authors cover various aspects related to blockchain including its taxonomies and the situations in which a particular category of blockchain should be applied. The authors also focusses on the structure of blockchain and the working of the ongoing transactions in the cryptocurrency network. In addition, the authors also specify various categories of consensus protocols, smart contracts, forks, techniques for generating the consensus. A detailed taxonomy of blockchain along with their features and related real-world applications is also discussed. In addition, existing key platforms of blockchain related to the cryptocurrencies, hyperledger and multichain are also discussed. Existing emerging vulnerabilities of blockchain related to the recent attacks on bitcoin and etherum is also presented along with the defensive methodologies and future trends in blockchain.},

Recently, a novel approach termed velvet fork, which expands upon the concept of a soft fork, was outlined in [22]. Specifically, velvet forks intend to avoid the possibility of disagreement by a change of rules through rendering modifications to the protocol backward compatible and inclusive to legacy blocks. We present an overview and definitions of these different upgrade mechanisms and outline their relationships. Hereby, we expose examples where velvet forks or similar constructions are already actively employed in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we expand upon the concept of velvet forks by proposing possible applications and discuss potentially arising security implications.},

It discusses relative merits of different measures that have been used for measurement of market liquidity viz. volume/ frequency of trading, turnover ratio and impact cost. It also measures changes in stock market liquidity on the basis of traditional measures such as turnover ratio. The paper proposes Elasticity of Trading as an alternate measure which easy to compute and has superior information content. The elasticity of trading measures volume of trading in relation to changes in prices. The paper analyses liquidity of equity trading on the National Stock Exchange with the help of Coefficient of Elasticity of Trading (CET) during April 1998 - May 2000. Some directions are suggested to assess the true potential of CET. This could be done by using CET for measuring liquidity in individual scrip. Similarly CET may be computed for period covering trading cycle.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the causal link between returns and volume in cryptocurrency markets. Relative to earlier empirical studies on the topic, it employs a flexible methodological approach that allows the intensity and the pattern of the link to vary with the traders' planning horizon (shorter vs longer runs) and the nature of the preceding price shocks (positive vs negative). Causality is bi-directional implying that: (a) volume-based technical analysis can lead to higher profits and (b) trend-following is likely to be a common investment strategy among rational uninformed traders. There is, therefore, scope for establishing appropriate disclosure systems to deal with information asymmetry and the risk associated with it. In the longer-run, spillovers from returns to volume are stronger than those in the opposite direction. The same, generally, applies to spillovers from positive relative to negative returns. Consequently, returns (especially the positive ones) are more likely to induce fundamental changes in traders' expectations compared to volume.},

abstract = {Bitcoin, is a decentralized cryptocurrency technology conceived by a mysterious person under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” It has the potential to revolutionize our concept of money both from a store of value and from a transfer or transactional value perspective. After a soft launch in 2009, Bitcoin has evolved into a multi-billion- dollar industry and spawned hundreds of other cryptocurrency systems. Collectively these cryptocurrencies are valued at over {\$}100 Billion in 2017. Bitcoin itself has risen from an initial value of zero (Coins were initially given away) in 2009, to a value of over {\$}15000 in 2017. There have been wide fluctuations in pricing, and several research papers have been written using various valuation methods to attempt to justify and predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper explores the background of what has led to today's valuation and develops a framework to arrive at valuing Bitcoin; the paper also addresses three main questions. Why are traditional valuation methods insufficient to arrive at a valuation of Bitcoin? How can companies and organizations build on the insights developed in this framework for Bitcoin valuation? And finally, the valuation framework is examined through the lens of key stakeholders and offers implications for researchers, investors, and policymakers.},

the value of a network is a function of the number of possible transaction pairs, and is proportional

new bitcoin. The result is a parsimonious model of supply (number of bitcoins) and demand

well. Metcalfe's law is used to investigate Gandal's et. al. [2018] assertion of price manipulation

abstract = {Initial coin offerings typically use blockchain technology to offer tokens that confer various rights in return, most often, for cryptocurrency. They can be seen as a conjunction of crowdfunding and blockchain. Based on a database of over 1000 ICO white papers, we provide a taxonomy of ICOs to increase understanding of their many forms, analyze the various regulatory challenges they pose, and suggest the first steps regulators should consider in response. As our database shows, ICOs are a global phenomenon and the global ICO market is much larger than generally thought, with overall ICO subscriptions estimated to exceed 75 billion USD as at the end of June 2018. The US ICO market is significant, but the US doesn't dominate this market, by any means. Furthermore, many  ICOs  are  offered  on  the  basis  of  utterly  inadequate  disclosure  of  information;  more  than  half  the  ICO  white  papers  are  either silent on the initiators or backers or do not provide contact details, and an even  greater  share  do  not  elaborate  on  the  applicable  law,  segregation  or  pooling of client funds, and the existence of an external auditor. Accordingly, the  decision  to  invest  in  them  often  cannot  be  the  outcome  of  a  rational  calculus. Hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble are present. At the same time,  ICOs  provide  a  new,  innovative and  potentially  important  vehicle  for raising funds to support innovative ideas and ventures, with the potential for aspects  of  their  underlying  structure  to  have  an  important  impact  on  fundraising systems and structures in future. },

The framework was applied to a case study and the results show that spin-off creation is an alternative to explore stagnated resources in a parent company upon a market opportunity. Separating the spin-off and integrating it into an innovation environment is a strategy to mitigate the market barriers; while factors such as public policies have limited impact on decision-making, they affect the process of the spin-off creation. The study points out that the creation of a spin-off occurs in a context guided primarily by the opportunity, due to strategic orientation of the parent company. Keywords:},

Second, daily returns exhibit persistent behavior in the first half of the period under study, whereas its behavior is more informational efficient since 2014. Finally, price volatility, measured as the logarithmic difference between intraday high and low prices exhibits long memory during all the period.

We also study the economic relevance of optimal liquidation strategies by calibrating a recent and realistic microstructure model with data from the Paris Stock Exchange. We distinguish between two cases: one in which the parameters are constant throughout the day and one in which they vary over time. We present and solve an optimization problem incorporating this realistic microstructure model. Our model endogenizes the trading periods required before a position is liquidated. A comparative static exercise demonstrates the realism of our model. We also examine the model for bearish and bullish beliefs, demonstrating that volatility plays a role in determining the speed of trade execution.},

Indeed, blockchain is driving companies to huge investments and strategic acquisitions, and it is raising innovation and research across industries and academia.

This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It introduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to several other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a non-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The analysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly correlated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a marginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the interactions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a causality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures and shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across currencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of significative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich structure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other both instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is that minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in shaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level of noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are significant with all links statistically validated and with a structural organisation consistently reproduced across all networks.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a well-established blockchain-based cryptocurrency that has attracted a great deal of attention from media and regulators alike. While millions of individuals invest in bitcoin, their motivations for doing so are less clear than with traditional investment decisions. We argue that the technical nature of bitcoin investments gives it unique characteristics and, consequently, that we lack a thorough understanding of how this affects the motivations behind bitcoin investment. We use a mixed method approach consisting of qualitative (n = 73) and quantitative (n = 150) studies and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify seven bitcoin-specific motivations (profit expectancy, ease of bitcoin acquisition, support of bitcoin ideology, investment skills, risk affinity, anticipated and experienced inaction regret) and how configurations of them explain bitcoin investment. The findings reveal, among others, that some individuals invest in bitcoin because they support the bitcoin ideology. Contrary to the traditional investment literature, profit expectancy is not a necessary condition to the extent that there is one empirical configuration of motivations that explains that individuals also invest in bitcoin even if they do not expect profits. The results disclose non-trivial investment motivation configurations and lay the groundwork for future studies of the role of cryptocurrencies in society.},

Misaligned incentives in different principal – agent scenarios are important risk factors from governance point of view. With blockchain, these misalignments are accounted for algorithmically, therefore novel governance models are possible. What role do risks play in terms of deciding for, or against the adoption of blockchain? How to best define requirements to achieve it? This paper explores standards and risk as factors, which can support or hinder the sustained application of blockchain in a broad scope of environments. We conducted a systematic literature review that outlines a current understanding of perceived risk surrounding the adoption and use of blockchain technology in the context of requirements engineering. Furthermore, selected models for managing risks are presented. Finally, areas where deeper research is required are identified. We conclude that a gap exists in normative frameworks that affect the adoption and sustainable use of blockchain technology. Closing this gap can support the sustainable use of blockchain technology.},

The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each {\$}1 of coin value created.

@article{Kumar2017,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the contemporaneous and causal relationship between returns (volatility) and trading volume in the Indian currency futures market for selected currency pairs; USD-INR, EUR-INR, GBP-INR and JPY-INR, from August 2008 to December 2014. Design/methodology/approach: The data for all the currency futures series has been taken from National Stock Exchange of India Limited which represents the daily settlement prices along with trading volume. The contemporaneous returns-volume relation is tested using the generalized method of moments, and Granger-causality framework impulse response function is used to test the predictive ability of returns (volatility) and volume for each other. Findings: The author reports a positive contemporaneous relationship between futures returns and trading volume which persists even after controlling for heteroskedasticity providing support to mixture of distribution hypothesis. The results show a unidirectional Granger causality from futures returns to volume. However, there is a significant bidirectional Granger causality between returns volatility and volume lending support to sequential arrival of information hypothesis. Next, the results for cross-currencies show significant influence of US dollar on the volume and returns of all other currencies. Overall, the author suggests that the short- to medium-term movements in the currency markets are dominated by market microstructure and not by fundamentals. Practical implications: The findings of this paper are very important for the participants in the market and regulators. The participants in the market require alternatives to diversify their risk. The significant relationship between futures returns (volatility) and trading volume implies that the current trading volume help predict the futures prices and should lead to creation of more reliable hedging strategies for investment purposes. Further, it may interest the regulators who need to decide upon the appropriateness of their policies in the currency futures market. Based on returns-volume relation, they need to set forth market restrictions such as daily price movement and position limits. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, no study has yet investigated the forecast ability of trading volume to price changes and their volatility in the Indian currency futures market. Given that currency futures market is one of the largest markets in the world, and Indian rupee has seen wide fluctuations in the recent years, it seems exciting to explore the price-volume relationship in the Indian currency futures market.},

It is surprising, though, to see that emerging e-coins have not been mapped into an index yet because with cryptos like Bitcoin, a new kind of asset of great public interest has arisen. Usually, the index provider decides on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a huge challenge to set this fixed number and develop the rules to find the constituents, especially since markets change and this has to be taken into account.

Five GARCH models, with different error distributions, are fitted to each of these crypto-currencies. The most effectively fit model or superior set of models is then selected through maximizing the likelihood and minimizing the AIC and BIC information criteria. The reached results prove that the majority of crypto-currencies turn out to be rather effectively modulated via the TGARCH with double exponential distribution. Indeed, the attained findings report an asymmetric effect whereby volatility turns out to increase rather by response to positive shocks than by response to negative shocks, implying an asymmetric effect that differs from that generally observed in stock markets. The increase in volatility, as emanating in response to positive shocks may well have its justification in the uninformed investors' undertaken herding strategies.},

abstract = {On August 1, 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain experienced a hard fork. The hard fork, spurred by concerns over Bitcoin's scalability, resulted in an entirely new blockchain and an accompanying new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin Cash. However, the new blockchain relies on the history of transactions recorded on the old blockchain. Consequently, at the time of the hard fork, every holder of Bitcoin could have received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. This sudden receipt of Bitcoin Cash poses a variety of tax problems. Should the acquired cryptocurrency qualify as income? If so, how should taxpayers calculate this income? Current income taxation law suggests the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork produced gain that, for the most part, was immediately realized. Thus, most taxpayers that received Bitcoin Cash at the time of the hard fork should have reported its value as income to the Internal Revenue Service. However, due to a variety of practical concerns, including a lack of sufficient analogous situations, cryptocurrency's volatility, and the IRS's refusal to follow relevant regulations related to the taxation of "treasure trove," perhaps it would be best to reconsider this conclusion and explore a solution that permits taxation of Bitcoin Cash upon a subsequent sale.},

abstract = {The model predicting Bitcoin price formation remains a mystery to academia and investors. Newly invented cryptocurrencies (alternative coins – altcoins) with enhanced features may become close substitutes to Bitcoin in terms of risk diversification. Employing Autoregressive-Distributed-Lag (ARDL) estimations, we document the evidence that the introduction of a new altcoin tends to lower Bitcoin return by 0.7{\%} which is substantial given that the average and median daily returns of Bitcoin are 0.63{\%} and 0.27{\%}, respectively. Our study suggests that the negative impact of an Initial Public Offering on existing stock prices can also be observed in the cryptocurrency market: altcoin introductions reduce Bitcoin return.},
